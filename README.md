This README provides basic information for some of the most commong tasks you'll have to perform during the development of the app.

## Requirements

* iOS 9.0+
* Xcode 7.0+

## Downloading and installing the project

You'll need a few things before getting started. Make sure you have the latests Xcode installed from the AppStore or Developer Site. Then you can clone the project with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pokeweak/pokemon-weakness-ios.git
```

After cloning the project you'll need to install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to manage all the Ruby dependencies on the project for building the project

```bash
sudo gem install bundler
```

After this just execute the following command to install all needed gems

```bash
sudo bundle install
```

## Getting started

Now that you've downloaded the project you'll need to run the app, we can run the app using [Xcode 7](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/). Make sure to open the `Pokemon Weakness.xcworkspace` workspace, and not the `Pokemon Weakness.xcodeproj` project.
Currently, the project is compatible with `Xcode 7` only, as it's `Swift 2`.

## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C & Swift, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. To learn more about this amazing tool you can check the their [docs](https://guides.cocoapods.org/). 

## Architecture üéØ

![Header](art/architecture.png)

The app is build on top of `my understanding` of [MVP pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) and trying to model the app so it can follow [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))

## Connect

All this layers are connected using [Promisekit](http://promisekit.org/) for the asynchronous part and we are married to `PromiseKit`  ¬Ø\(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø

## Dependency injection üíâ

Dependency injection is has been achieved by using [Service Locator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/library/ff648968.aspx) pattern with an `Assembly` that's the one in charge of keeping all the references, I took this approach by using swift extensions of this `Assembly` so it's easier to link dependencies.

## Libraries used in this project
